        <p>
            Bangladesh food recipes and traditional cuisine varies between very sweet and mild to extremely spicy.
            Because of that, even tourists from other South East Asian countries find the food spicy! It closely
            resembles north-east Indian and S.E. Asian food â€“ more than any other part of the Subcontinent. This is most
            likely due to geographic and cultural proximity.
